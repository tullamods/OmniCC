# this is derived from https://github.com/BigWigsMods/packager/wiki/GitHub-Actions-workflow
# the only real modifications I've made are to handle only specific tag formats
name: Package and build release versions

# when a tag is created with the format vx.y.z or x.y.z
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*.*.*"
      - "v*.*.*"
      - "!v*.*.*-*"
      - "!*.*.*-*"

# a workflow is built up as jobs, and within these jobs are steps
jobs:
  # "release" here can be anything in one word
  release:
    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets from the project on GitHub
    env:
      CF_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
      GITHUB_OAUTH: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    # "steps" holds a list of all the steps needed to package and release our AddOn
    steps:

      # we first have to clone the AddOn project, which is simple enough, and is a required step
      - name: Clone project
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # once cloned, we just run the GitHub Action for the packager project
      - name: Package and release
        uses: BigWigsMods/packager@master
        with:
          args: -p 2057 -w 4836

      # another example where we supply additional arguments, this example is specifically to release
      # for the Classic version of the game
      - name: Package and release for Classic
        uses: BigWigsMods/packager@master
        with:
          args: -g 1.13.6 -p 2057 -w 4836

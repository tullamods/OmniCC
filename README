OmniCC is an addon that adds text to items/spells/abilities that are on cooldown to indicate when they'll be ready for use. OmniCC should be compatible with any addon that uses a cooldown model.
A configuration interface is included, and can be shown via /omnicc or /occ

How do I use this crazy thing?
I've written a fairly detailed guide for OmniCC 4, which can be found here:
http://code.google.com/p/tullamods/wiki/OmniCC4


Changes since OmniCC 3:
Added the ability to define settings groups. Groups allow you to define custom settings for things like auras/action buttons, etc.
Added options to adjust text anchoring.
Switched to using the animation system for timers, resulting in a major reduction in overall CPU usage

Development
OmniCC development has moved from GogleCode to GitHub. The intention is to make it easier for people to fork/contribute to OmniCC development (and also for me to learn about git). Writing code for me typically gets your request implemented faster than asking me to write it myself
